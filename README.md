# NEAT-Custom-Implementation
I've implemented NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) from scratch using information from K. O Stanley's original NEAT research paper as well as his neat-users-page Q&amp;A. This algorithm dynamically evolves neural networks by adding nodes and connections, optimizing weights, and using speciation to maintain diversity.
